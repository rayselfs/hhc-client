# Learnings — constant deduplication

- Extracted VIDEO_EXTENSIONS and NON_NATIVE_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS to src/config/media.ts to create single source of truth.
- Kept original values exactly to avoid behavior changes.
- Followed existing config file pattern (export const ...).
- Verified by running type-check and unit tests; all tests passed.
- Verification commands used:
  - npm run type-check
  - npm run test:unit
  - grep -r "const VIDEO_EXTENSIONS\|const NON_NATIVE_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS" src/composables/ (no results)

Recommendation: Add a small comment in media.ts if lists need future extension and consider using a centralized media utility for related helpers.

- Lazy-load verification: After changing Home route to dynamic import, ran type-check and build; HomeView produced separate CSS and JS assets:
  - assets/HomeView-AdnSXXDm.js
  - assets/HomeView-7uW4MG3u.css
    Verification commands: `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`, `ls dist-electron/renderer/assets/ | grep -i home`
- Added barrel export files for Timer and Media/Preview to match existing patterns (e.g., Bible, Media, Alert). Files created:
  - src/components/Timer/index.ts (exports 9 components)
  - src/components/Media/Preview/index.ts (exports 6 components)

Pattern notes:

- Use "export { default as Name } from './Name.vue'" for Vue single-file components.
- Barrel files live at the folder root and re-export individual .vue files to simplify imports.

Verification performed:

- vue-tsc type-check: passed
- npm run build: passed
- grep for imports referencing the new barrels: no direct usages found (safe to add barrels without breaking imports)

Next steps: If consumers should import from the barrel, open a follow-up task to refactor import sites to use the barrel paths.
